        <h1 class="animal_name">African wild dogs</h1>
          <p> ONE of the coolest African wild dog facts is that they are the most efficient hunters of any large predator, and succeed at a rate of over 80%. The African wild dog, also known as the Cape hunting dog, and African painted dog, is a large, intelligent, canine with a complex social life similar to a wolf.
          the hot plains and grasslands of Africa, wild dogs live in tight-knit packs of 20 to 40 animals, the members of which remain so for their entire lives, Often confused with hyenas and having a bit of a reputation.

            African wild dogs regularly appear on peoples least-liked animals list. This page however, is unashamedly partial and will attempt to gain favor upon these fabulous fellows whose intense social drives echo back to the first four paws to ever recline beside us in dark caves of centuries past.
            
            Wild dogs are achingly social, playful, and full of mischief and raw energy. They are constantly on the move, rarely staying in one location for more than a day or two, and this need for roaming space has contributed to their critical status in the wild.
            
            There are no preserves large enough to comfortably contain a pack of African wild dogs, and when they stray out onto farmlands and roadways, they fall prey to car bumpers and farmers bullets.
            
            The African wild dog is the second largest canine in the world, with the northern grey wolf being much heavier, but not neccessarily taller.
            
            These dogs make lots of eerie noises and their habits of grinning and bowing to one another to show submission and friendship is perceived as skulking, and kind of creepy to many observers.
            
            The most unfortunate habit wild dogs have is their hunting style, or rather their killing style. As opposed to using a choke hold or a kill bite like most predators,  African wild dogs will -as a group- grab a piece of their victim and basically tear it apart.
            
            This is an absolutely horrific sight, but actually may be a shorter death for the hapless victim. - African Wild Dog Facts.
        </p>
        <h3 class="animal_subtitle">the African wild dog power pack</h3>
        <p>
            The African wild dogs intensely close pack structure is its greatest strength, making the pack a force to be reckoned with.

Wild dogs are the most efficient hunters in Africa. They are successful  80% of the time in bringing down antelope, pig, and massive prey such as zebra and wildebeast that may easily be 10 times the size of an individual dog. 

After the hunt, the meal is freely distributed to pups, the nursing mom, and the sick, old or injured.

Although they make a tremendous amount of noise and may scream and squabble,  African wild dogs are rarely aggressive with each other. In fact, it is often a race to submission rather than dominance, with each dog giving the other a wide-lipped grin, bowing their heads low and "ha- ha" or "huffing" in reverance.

The wild dog pack is extremely tight-knit and works as a big, well-oiled machine because of this harmony.

They build up each others confidence with group "rallies" where they trot about shoulder to shoulder, tails held high, jostling and mouthing each other, definitely similar to wolves, but also to football players before the big game.With the right numbers on their side, they will take on some of the largest land predators in the world, including hyenas and African lions, surrounding and tormenting their foe with a circle of grimacing determination.

Wild dogs don't generally kill these big adversaries, although there are accounts of them doing so.

Usually though, the plan is just to gain whatever the larger animal had in its possesion, or drive it from their territory.
        </p>
        <h3 class="animal_subtitle">african wild dog reproduction</h3>
        <p>
            Within the pack generally only the dominant male and female, called the Alpha pair, will reproduce.

After a  six week pregnancy the Alpha female will find a safe place, often an abandoned aardvark den, where she may deliver up to 20 puppies in a single litter - the most in the canine kingdom!

More commonly about 10 puppies are born. The entire pack helps in the rearing of this one litter. In the world of wild dogs it is the submissive animal who can most fervently beg that tends to eat first.

Food is distributed to the youngest pack members and sometimes the Alpha pair are actually be the last dogs to eat. The pack will settle down for several weeks while the pups are growing, going out to hunt twice a day and bringing food back in thier bellies which they will regurgitate for the mother and pups to eat.

At some point, however, in a strange twist, the mother will join in the hunts - being the Alpha female with lots of experience- and several designated "babysitters, usually males, will stay behind.

Because the entire pack contributes to the raising of one large litter of puppies a year, African wild dog puppies catch on quick, and may be seen out hunting with the pack by the time they are 6 months old.
        </p>
        <h3 class="animal_subtitle">Girl Power </h3>
        <p>
            Female African wild dogs are often larger than males, and many male/female roles in the pack structure are reversed.

Although the pack most often hunts together, when the Alpha female has a young litter, it is usually a small group of adult males that will remain back at the den with her, tending to the many pups, while a hunting party of swift and powerful females set out first thing in the morning, and then again in late afternoon to procure the two meals a day the pack enjoys.

But in one of the most unique role reversals, small groups of young females wean away from the pack to form a new pack of their own, or join a pack whose females have also left, while the majority of young males stay with the pack their entire lives, dutifully tending to the needs of another males puppies. Amazing!

            <h1 class="animal_name">Baboon</h1>
            <p>
                There are five species of old world monkeys known as baboons. The olive, yellow, chacma, hamadryas and guinea baboons of the genus papio. The mandrill, which is the monkey with the colorful face, was once classified in the same genus as the baboons, but was moved to its own in 1970.</p>
               <p> Another large terrestrial monkey often referred to as a baboon is the gelada, a dramatic looking animal with bare red flesh over its heart. Although the mandrill and gelada are not technically baboons, they are very closely related and have very similar lifestyles, and so are often included in discussions of baboons.</p>

                <p>Baboons are very distinctive looking monkeys inhabiting much of Africa and some areas of Asia. They have long, almost dog-like snouts, very close-set eyes, and their arms and legs are almost the same length, so they walk very much like a dog.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes referred to as "dog monkeys" baboons are very common in the African landscape. They are very social animals that live in large, lively groups called "troops" of up to 100 members.</p>

                        <p>Baboons spend the majority of the day walking on all fours on the ground. They retire to the trees at night, and are very good climbers, but like all Old World monkeys their tail is not prehensile and cannot assist in climbing other than with balance.</p>

                            <p>The mandrill is the largest monkey species and has just a stump of a tail.</p>

                                <p>Grooming, feeding together, and general socializing are key to the well being of the baboon troop. Baboons are very vocal and communicate not only with about 40 different distinct vocalizations but with numerous hand and arm gestures and very expressive faces.</p>

                                    <p>They have very mobile lips, cheeks and brows, and have distinct expressions for submission, begging and initiating play. Baboons make allot of eye contact with each other and are very affectionate, holding hands, hugging, and of course, mutually grooming.
                                        Baboons are one of the few animals other than humans that have been seen "staring into each others eyes".</p>

                                            <p>The large troop splits into smaller units for foraging during the day, and and is made up of closely related females and their young, with unrelated males trying to gain favor or dominance over females.</p>

                                                <p>Baboon society is generally rather peaceful and cooperative with multiple adults assisting in the rearing of youngsters and troops actively involved in the defense of all members. Some species, the chacma and hamadryas in particular,  and some individual troops prove to be much more violent, however, and fighting among males to gain dominance may also include infanticide.</p>

                                                    <p>There is extreme size difference between the sexes with adult males usually at least twice as large as adult females. The hamadryas baboon male develops an amazing white mane as it matures, and of course, the mature male mandrill has a colorful snout of red, white and blue, with a ruff of golden fur under his chin and similar colors on his rump. In fact, the male mandrill is probably the most colorful mammal in the animal kingdom.</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Baboon lifestyle</h3>
            <p>
                Troops of loud and energetic olive and yellow baboons are an iconic sight on the African savanna. These baboons are the most common of the baboon species and some of the largest monkey species overall.

They are extremely similar and there is some question as to whether they should be considered separate species. The yellow baboon is lighter in color, slightly smaller and has a different home range than the olive. Both have almost identical lifestyles . Neither of these species are currently endangered,  but as human beings encroach upon more of their territory conflicts are more common.

Today, human beings are the number one predator of baboons. Baboons have been known to raid crops, and even break into barns and outbuildings. They will kill and eat farm fowl and small animals such as goats and rabbits as well.

Farmers defend their crops by hunting down baboons and troops that have raided barns or buildings have been hunted down by entire towns of people.

The very smart and resourceful baboon has put itself in harms way through its own nerve and cleverness. Another potential threat to these animals is an increase in their use in research laboratories.  Recent international agreements have slowed and stopped much of the use of chimpanzees in research facilities, but the baboon and other primate species remain unprotected and are being used to fill a void.  

The baboon is a remarkably bright creature that not only has a very complex social life, but is also similar to our ancestors in its ability to adapt to life outside of heavy forest.

The olive and yellow baboons willingness to forage for a large variety of foods from roots to insects, to, on rare occasions, small prey like birds and fawns, and its cooperative, relatively peaceful society find it living in the open savanna where few other primates have ever flourished.

Out on the savanna the olive and yellow baboons regularly encounter some of the largest predators in the world. Lions, leopards, African wild dogs and hyenas have all hunted baboons, and the baboon troop keeps a wary eye out for all these animals.

In general, baboons are very quick, and tend to avoid capture by some of these larger beasts, and baboons have been known to torment large predators, particularly old male lions, when they are sure the odds are in their favor.

In addition to interactions with unfriendly neighbors, baboons have been observed interacting playfully with mongooses and chimpanzees. These species have overlapping ranges where forests meet the open plains.


            </p>
            <h3>Baboon reproduction</h3>
            <p>
                The female baboon comes into season about every 37 days and this is marked by pronounced sexual swelling. The genitals engorge and are bright pink in color indicating her condition. Her entire rump swells during this time and males show great interest.

Baboons are promiscuous and both males and females have multiple partners. Sometimes males will be possessive of certain females and fights may break out, but it is not only the most aggressive or dominant males that have a chance to mate.

Males will form friendships with females where they will escort, groom, share food and even help in the rearing of youngsters in order to gain favor with a female. Sometimes this works, sometimes she goes off with another more attractive suitor. Friendships between unrelated males and females may be lifelong, whether or not they involve sexual activity.

Females show their interest in a male by presenting their rump. The female will be pregnant for 6 months and give birth to one, very rarely two youngsters. The baby is helpless, but eyes are open and the infant is well furred.

The newborn baboon also has the typical young primates ingrained gripping reflex, and is able to hold itself against its mothers belly with tightly grasping hands and feet almost immediately after birth. Infants ride against the mothers stomach for the first several weeks, and then begin to ride on her back, usually in an upright position like a little jockey.

As youngsters begin to explore, they  spend lots of  time with their peers in active and exciting playgroups overlooked by several moms. Mothers are cooperative in the rearing of young and are protective of their friends youngsters.

Mothers can also be seen giving little lessons to groups of youngsters, and sharing food with multiple kids in the neighborhood. Males can be helpful with child rearing as well, and will also actively defend any youngster from predators.

The baboon society is matrilineal in form, with mothers, daughters and grandmothers staying together for their lifetimes. The social rank of the mother is usually passed along to the daughter. Young females stay with their troop for life, young males usually move on to another troop where they earn their way in by winning favor with females and older males by submissive grooming and friendship behaviors, or in some species, with active fighting to gain rank.

This period in a young males life is called "dispersal" and usually occurs sometime around the 7th or 8th year. Males will occasionally live in several different troops over their lifetime.

The hamadryas baboons are the exception to this lifestyle,  having a different type of society with smaller groups of either one dominant male with a harem, or bachelor males. There is some agression between males and females among the hamadryas baboons, and lots of conflict between competing males.

In all baboon societies, as with many primates, there is a degree of infanticide that takes place, when male dominance roles are being disputed.

            <h1 class="animal_name">Badger</h1>
            <p>
                One of the more curious badger facts is that a large part of their diet is earthworms. Badgers are stoutly built, powerful and cantankerous carnivores. There are eight species of badger ranging across several continents including North America, Africa, Europe and Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the badger species are fossorial, creating many-chambered underground dens, and spending much of their lives below ground.

Badgers do allot of stalking at night, but are seen out and about in the daytime as well. They are excellent hunters of earth-dwelling prey including rabbits, groundhogs, ground squirrels, mice and snakes.

Some of these animals can be fairly large in comparison to the badger, but are no match for this enormously aggressive predator.

The badgers sense of smell is very powerful and they can detect an animal in its burrow through soil as well as snow cover. When they locate their prey, they dig rapidly directly down into the animals den in a devastating surprise attack from above.

Badgers also eat a variety of insects, grubs and vegetable matter including fruits and roots.

The word "badger" comes from the French word "becheur" meaning "digger" and is extremely appropriate. Everything about a badgers body says "dig".
            </p>
            <p>
                It has massive, shovel-like front paws with five powerful toes, each tipped with curved claws as strong as steel. They can move yards of dirt in minutes, barreling in head first with long digging strokes of the front legs and quick, earth-moving shoves backwards with the rear legs.

The rear paws and claws are smaller and designed to doze away the soil that has already been loosened and dislodged by the front feet.

Badgers have a third eyelid that protects their eyes from all the flying soil, and thick guard hairs in their nostrils and ears to keep them clear of debris.

A badger being pursued by a large predator such as a wolf or mountain lion can dig backwards, fangs facing out for protection and disappear beneath the soil in a matter of seconds.

In addition, the badger has very thick fur and loose skin which allows it to twist around, even when having been grabbed from behind by a predator, to defend itself with its impressive canines.

Most badgers live solitary lives once weaned from their mother, but have overlapping territories and may occasionally run into each other and socialize.. - Badger Facts


            </p>
            <h3 class="animal_subtitle"> American or new world badger </h3>
            <p>The American badger is a fixture across the plains and woodlands of the central United States. They range into Canada and Mexico as well, but the midwestern plains are their most common residence.</p>
            <p>These badgers have a flattened appearance with a remarkably broad torso, short, powerful limbs, and massive front paws and claws. They have a grizzled grey body with whiter undersides and dark brown or black legs. The stripe down the center of the face is narrow compared to the European badger, and the skull and cheeks are wider with low-set ears and black cheek patches. And badgers have stout tails of a few inches in length.</p>
            <p>The jaw of the American badger sets into the skull in a unique notch that locks it to the upper mandible and makes it impossible to be dislocated.</p>
            <p>Many of the animals the badger hunts are powerfully built diggers as well, such as the muscular groundhog and rugged prairie dog, who will wedge their sturdy legs against the walls of their dens trying to avoid extraction.</p>
            <p>The specialized jaw, along with the badgers stout neck and shoulders helps the badger to dislodge its quarry. It is occasionally reported that badgers and coyotes team up to hunt, but what actually occurs is that the always "wily" coyote waits at alternative exits for something to bolt loose from a burrow that the badger is invading. If the coyote snares an escaping gopher it does not share with the badger, and the badger certainly does not share with the coyote.</p>
            <p>The American badger has numerous potential enemies on the Western plains, such as mountain lions, wolves and the ever annoying coyote.These animals may out weigh a badger by three or four to one, but an adult badger is as fierce a combatant as one may encounter and more often than not, sends its agitator running for the hills.</p>

            <h3 class="animal_subtitle">European Or Old World Badger</h3>

            <p>The European badger is also known as the Old World badger and the Eurasian badger.As these names imply, it ranges throughout most of Europe and some parts of Western Asia.The European badger has a more elongated head, a much wider white stripe down the center of the face, and appears slightly more upright than the American badger, which tends to have a somewhat "flattened" look.</p>
            <p>Although a solitary animal in much of its range, the European badgers of Britain and some other territories are the most social of the badger species and live in groups of 5 to 20 individuals in enormous dens that may have up to thirty different chambers and 1/2 a mile of tunnels. Some of these burrows called "setts" are decades old and are occasionally shared by other animals including red foxes and even raccoons.</p>
            <p>European badgers also tend to travel on well-worn trails, some of which have been in use for hundreds of years. </p>

               <p> This is the largest of the badger species reaching as much as 40 pounds in the late summer as it fattens up for a potentially hard winter.</p>
                
                <p>Badgers do not hibernate, but will enter a state known as torpor if the weather gets rough and snows are too deep to hunt. </p>
                
               <p> Torpor is a deep sleep that may lasts for up to three weeks but does not involve the extreme slowing of heartbeat that actual hibernation involves.</p>
                
               <p>The European badger is slightly less aggressive then the other badger species and does not take prey quite as large as the other badgers, actually spending long hours digging for their favorite food- earthworms.</p>

               <h3 class="animal_subtitle">Baby Badgers</h3>

               <p>Badgers come together to mate in the late summer and early autumn and both males and females may mate with multiple partners. Once the female is impregnated, the development of the embryos is delayed over the winter, so that the baby badgers arrive when the weather is right. The eggs don't fully attach to the uterus until early spring. This is a process known as "delayed implantation", and is one of the more unusual badger facts.</p>

               <p>In late winter or early spring, the eggs become implanted in the uteran wall and begin to develop. Although the entire pregnancy takes about 7 months from fertilization to delivery, the eggs do not develop at all for the first 5 months, and then, once implanted, take about 6 weeks to fully grow.</p>
                
               <p> Females give birth deep inside their burrows to 2 to 5 baby badgers.  The newborn badger babies are called cubs. They are blind and only very finely furred, and completely dependent on their mother.</p>
                
               <p>  She may leave every few days to hunt, but returns quickly. The mother badger may change dens once or twice during these critical weeks to ensure the safety of her family.</p>
                
              <p>She carries each badger cub one at a time to the new sette. Baby badgers mature quickly and begin chewing on kills their mother provides for them, sometimes even before their eyes are open.</p>
                
              <p> By the time they are 4 months old, a baby badger can hunt for themselves and they head out on their own at about 6 months old. </p>
               
              <h3 class="animal_subtitle">The Honey Badger Or Ratel</h3>

              <p>The honey badger is in a separate genus from the American and European badgers, and is actually more closely related to wolverines and weasels.</p>

              <P>Nevertheless, the honey badger is exceedingly "badger-like", and has a reputation for being one of the most fearless and relentless animals on Earth.</p>

            <h1 class="animal_name"> Bats</h1>
             <p>Bats are separated into two suborders called megabats and microbats. As the names imply, the megabats are the largest bat species, and the microbats are the smallest.

                Microbats are carnivores or insectivores who have small eyes and generally use echo-location to hunt.
                
                Megabats, like the enormous flying fox, which has an average wingspan of over 4 feet, are fruit or nectar eating animals.
                
                Megabats have large eyes and fairly good vision. Although it was once thought that they do not echo-locate, there are some species of fruit bats that have been discovered to use wing noises, not vocal clicks, to help find their way in the dark.
                
                The insect-eating microbats may consume hundreds or even thousands of insects in an evening. They spend their days hanging upside down by their hind toes beneath a bridge, in the roof of a barn, or in a cave, and then swoop out, often in colonies of hundreds, come dusk, to flit around in the sky snatching mosquitoes as they go.
                
                The bat is an animal that causes many folks to squirm in fear or disgust, but without them, the world would be over run with mosquitoes, gnats and flies, and diseases like malaria and West Nile virus would be far more prevalent. 
                
                It is conceivable that without the many millions of insect eating bats in the world, the human population might even be in peril.
                
                Not all microbats eat insects, however. Several species eat small rodents and reptiles. A few even eat fish, snatching them out of the water with their hind claws just like bald eagles do.
                
                Three species of bats from Mexico and South America eat the blood of living (usually sleeping) animals.
                
                These vampire bats are tiny creatures that make 1/4 inch punctures in the skin and lap up the blood with their tongues - gruesome!
                
                Their victims are generally sheep and cattle, and usually don't feel a thing as the vampire bat strikes at night and leaves without a sound.
                
                The small, insect eating microbat species are not restricted to tropical jungles or lost caverns, but are quite comfortably adapted to urban living.
                
                Although they live largely undetected, bats are very common and very populous throughout the worlds major cities, roosting in the eaves of skyscrapers and famous landmarks like the Eiffel tower and the Statue of Liberty, waiting for sundown to swoop out and hunt under the stars in Central Park or Piccadilly Circus.
                
                </p>
                <h3 class="animal_subtitle"> Are Bats Blind? </h3>
                <p>The expression "blind as a bat" is actually a very old simile that is not at all accurate. Its origin is understandable though, when you know how bats fly in the dark.

                    Insect eating bats use echolocation, or biological sonar, to track down insects as they fly.
                    
                    Sonar stands for SOund NAvigation and Ranging.
                    
                    These bats send out incredibly rapid squeaks, clicks, and chirps - (over 100 per second!) - that are such a high frequency human beings can't hear them.
                    
                    The chirps bounce off surrounding objects and are interpreted instantaneously by the bat. The bats extra large ears and excellent hearing are designed for this task.
                    
                    They make these sounds with their larynx, tand sometimes their nose, which is why some bats have such odd, often scary looking faces, with folds of skin called "nose leaves", which funnel chirps out in the right direction. 
                    
                    Based on the echos it receives, a bat can "see" it's environment in total darkness, and track the fight of dozens of insects at a time as it flies. It plots a course and zigs and zags up, down and back to catch insects in mid air.
                    
                    All of this activity may give the appearance of a very awkward and erratic animal that "can't fly straight" and "can't see where it's going", while in reality the bat knows exactly what its next move should be and adjust its flight in a fraction of a second. 
                    
                    Bats have been known to fly into trees and even crash into each other when there are too many in one place, however.
                    
                    Their signals get crossed and they must disperse quickly in order to avoid each other. This is why large colonies fly out of their roosts at such great speeds at dusk, they are trying to fly clear of each other as quickly as possible.
                    
                    In addition to being able to echo-locate in the dark, bats can and do actually use their eyes to see in the daylight, and probably have similar vision to humans.
                    
                    They are nocturnal animals though, and their eyes are fairly sensitive to light.
                    
                    They may shield their eyes with their wings - just like Dracula - when a flashlight hits them, and that my add to the idea that there is something amiss with their eyesight.
                    
                    So, long story short, not only can bats see just as good as humans in the daylight, they "see" better than an owl at night - by using their mouth and their ears!</p>

                    <h3 class="animal_subtitle"> How Do Bat Fly </h3>
                    <p>Bats are the only mammals with wings. </p>

                       <p>The wings of all bats are comprised of two thin layers of flexible skin that are stretched between the sides of the body, and the bats extremely long finger bones.
                        
                        The wing membrane connects all the way down to the ankles in megabats and continues between the legs in microbats.</p>
                        <p>The wings make up about 95% of the surface area of the body.

                            Blood vessels and nerves run between the layers and the bat has full feeling and a great deal of mobility of the wings. In fact, the many joints present in the bat wing compared to the bird wing makes the bat a more agile and efficient flyer.
                            
                            The bats wings have two dozen joints that allow for the catching and cupping of air which creates far greater lift.</p>
                            
                           <p>The thumb of the bat is not webbed and sticks out of the top of the wing. It has a sharp claw used for climbing into roosting positions.
                            
                            Some bats actually hunt insects on the ground and crawl around quite a bit with the use of the claws. Flying foxes will also groom themselves with their claws.</p>

            <h1 class="animal_names"> caracal</h1>
             <p>One of the coolest caracal facts is that they are known to have a vertical leap of over 10 feet!</p>

              <p>The caracal is a medium sized wild cat found in arid regions of Africa, India and the Middle East. They average about 20 inches at the shoulder and range from 20 to 40 pounds, with males being quite a bit larger than females.
                
                The caracal is also known as the Persian lynx and the gazelle cat.
                
                The most distinctive caracal characteristics are the long tufts of black hair on the tips of the ears.
                
                The actual function of these tufts is not known, although some speculate they may keep insects or sunshine out of the eyes, or even be used to communicate with other caracals.
                
                Caracals are typically solid colored reddish tan with a lighter underbelly and white "eyeliner" that sets off their beautiful features. Black eyebrow markings complete the picture.
                
                Just as there are solid black leopards and jaguars, caracals can also be found in solid black. Black caracals are very rare, and may occur side by side in the same litter as normally colored caracals.
                
                They are powerfully built, with long, sturdy legs that act like springs, allowing them to leap straight up and snatch Birds right out of the air.
                
                The hind legs are longer than the fronts, and the topline slopes slightly from the hips to the shoulders..
                
                The tail is bobbed at about a 3/4 length, but is well-muscled and used as a rudder in the air.
                
                Along with birds, caracals eat an assortment of small animals, rodents, rabbits, reptiles and occasionally large insects.
                
                They have also been known to take down prey much larger than themselves, including small antelope and goats.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caracal is a solitary animal, active mostly at night. Their nocturnal tendency make them a rare sight, and their cunning and agility make them highly proficient hunters.

                    They mark their large territories with urine and claw marks, and though they may not run into eachother, they keep track of, and know the scent of the other caracals in the area.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the breeding season they will pair off for a day or two to mate, but once impregnated the female drives the male away.

She may use an abandoned burrow or cave as a den, but usually just finds a secluded area of thick underbrush next to a rock or tree, where she will have 2 to 4 kittens.

Caracal kittens are born with their eyes closed and their ears curled up. It takes a full three weeks for the characteristic ears to unfurl.

The caracal was a prized creature in ancient Egypt, but was particularly prominent in ancient Chinese culture.

They were tamed, kept on jeweled collars and leashes, and given as gifts to guests and nobility.

Their hunting and leaping skills were put on display in competitions where several caracals were released into a flock of pigeons.

Wagers were taken as to which cat would snag the most hapless birds.

Today, the caracal is occasionally kept as a pet, but they have never been domesticated and owning one requires alot of dedication and preparation.

They are, big, powerful animals with a strong prey drive and the desire to roam which can make them destructive and frustrated in the wrong environment.

            <h1 class="animal_names"> cougar</h1>
              <p>One of the most often discussed cougar facts is that they are known by so many different names including mountain lion, puma, catamount and panther.

                But all of these names refer to the same magnificent, tawny colored cat.
                
                Averaging between 24 and 28 inches at the shoulder, with the largest males topping 260 pounds, the cougar is bigger, on average, than the African leopard.
                
                </p>  
                <p>But the cougar, commonly called mountain lion, is not considered one of the "big cats", while the smaller leopard is. Why?

                    Well, first because they are more closely related to smaller cat species, like bobcats and even domestic cats, than they are to the big cats, and second, because they cannot roar.</p>

                    <p>There are six sub-species of cougars ranging all throughout South and Central America, as well as Mexico, Western North America, and Florida.

                        This is a solitary, stealthy cat that is most active at dusk and dawn, and sneaks through the shadows largely undetected.</p>

                        <p>
                            They live in many completely different habitats, from snow covered mountains, to tropical forests to swamps.

Because the places they live are so different, so too, are what cougars eat.

In the Rocky mountains of the Western United States, where they are called "mountain lions", their diet is mule deer, elk, moose and rocky mountain goats.

In the jungles of South America where they are called "pumas", they dine on wild boar and monkeys.

In the swamps of Florida where they are called "panthers", they eat baby alligators, snakes and pigs.

In the deserts of Mexico where they are called wildcats, they hunt jackal and hares.

The cougars skeleton is lightweight, and the body is extremely well muscled.

The paws are very large, and the hind legs are longer than the fronts, allowing the cougar to coil up and pounce on prey with devastating accuracy.

They are ambush hunters, hiding behind rocks or atop a tree limb, waiting for their victim to get close enough, then going in for the finish with a kill bite to the back of the neck.

The cougar is capable of a 15 foot vertical leap, and has been reported to clear horizontal distances of 30 feet.

The cougar is a serious carnivore and an excellent hunter consuming meat exclusively and hunting and killing almost everything it eats.

If the prey is large, such as a moose or elk, they will drag it to a secluded area and return to feed over several days.

Cougars rarely, if ever, scavenge, except in populated areas and campgrounds.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cougars can be a menace for cattle ranchers and can easily take down a full grown cow.

                            Because of this, they have been tracked down and hunted out of existence across many square miles of range land.
                            
                            But they are not endangered, except for the very rare Florida panther sub-species, and many cougars live in remarkably close proximity to human beings without us even knowing they are there.
                            
                            Spotting a mountain lion in the wild is extremely rare, but hikers often find clues of their presence like scat, recent kills, and scratches left on trees.
                            
                            Cougar attacks on humans do occur, but are very rare, in fact, less than 30 people have ever been reported as being killed by mountain lions</p>

            <h1 class="animal_names">fossa</h1>
            <p>One of the coolest fossa facts is that they only exist on the island of Madagascar. </p>

               <p>Madagascar is a large island nation located off the southeast coast of Africa, where some very unique creatures live.
                
                
                The fossa, a close relative of the mongoose, is Madagascar's largest predator, and the only animal to regularly and successfully hunt the islands largest lemur species.
                
                The fossa looks very much like a small, brown cougar, but it is not a cat.
                
                Fossas are small animals at about 15 inches at the shoulder.
                
                They are rarely more than 30 inches long, not including the equally long tail, and they average somewhere between 15 and 30 pounds, with males a bit larger than females.
                
                Fossas live in well-vegetated forest throughout the island, and range over large territories, sometimes traveling many miles in a single day.
                
                They scent-mark their territories by spraying musty secretions from their anal glands.</p>


                <p>The fossa's tail is thick, somewhat rigid, and as long as it's body.
                    The limbs are stout, with wide, fleshy paws and strong, arched toes.

                    Fossas appear to be a fusion of mountain lion and mongoose, slinky and low to the ground like a mongoose, powerfully muscled and agile like a cougar.
                    
                    The head is a fantastic, expressive wedge-shape, with a big, wet dog-like nose, round, wide-set ears like a bear, a feline face, and unusual, somewhat spooky eyes.
                    
                    Although not nocturnal, the fossa will hunt day or night, and can see very well in the dark.
                    
                    In the light of day, the pupils become tiny, vertical slits, nearly disappearing.
                    
                    It is a creature that has been feared in its native land for centuries because of its secretive existence and haunting appearance.
                    
                    The fossa was believed to be a demon on earth, that would steal infants from their cradles or lull victims into a trance then slowly disembowel them.
                    
                    The fossa will emit a musky scent when agitated, and it was once thought that the scent alone could kill birds and small animals.
                    
                    Fossas live in forested areas where they scent mark large territories.
                    
                    They don't live in dens but rather sleep on limbs, sometimes sunning themselves.
                    
                    They are solitary animals that are virtually silent.
                    
                    Fossas are cathemeral, meaning they may be active day or night, alternating swift activity with deep naps.                  </p>

            <h1 class="animal_names">Honey badger</h1>
            <p>One of the coolest honey badger facts is that they are known to kill cobras.

                The honey badger is not a true badger.
                
                The honey badger is in a separate genus from the American and European badgers, and is actually more closely related to wolverines and weasels.
                
                10 Ferret Facts You may Never Heard...
                
        
                
            
               <h3> 10 Ferret Facts You may Never Heard about. </h3>
            </p> Nevertheless, the honey badger is exceedingly "badger-like", and has a reputation for being one of the most fearless and relentless animals on Earth.
                
               <p> Honey badgers are native to most of Africa and parts of Southwest Asia.
                
               </p>In Africa it is commonly called the "ratel".
                
                <p>word has the same meaning as the word "rattle", and refers to the sound that these excitable animals make when they are agitated, which is actually quite often.
                
              <p> The honey badger is a relatively small animal averaging about 25 pounds, with large males occasionally reaching 35 pounds.</p>

                <p>They are long-bodied with short, powerful legs, standing about 12 inches at the shoulder.

                    Honey badgers are solitary animals that spend a great deal of time actively, noisily, patrolling large territories in search of almost anything edible.
                    
                    They are mostly carnivorous hunters, but will try a variety of foods including fruits and even some flower species. </p>
                    
                   <p>They scavenge for carrion but also actively hunt and eat a large variety of prey, including birds, reptiles and even young monkeys, but are especially fond of honey, of course.</p>


                    <p>They will seek out and attack honey bee hives with incredible determination, accepting hundreds of stings while they eat honey, honey comb and their favorite, the bee larvae which is located at the center of the hive.

                        Honey badgers are not only able to accept stings from bees, but can also handle bites from the worlds deadliest snakes, like puff adders, mambas and cobras, which they happily hunt, kill and devour.
                        
                        The honey badger is not necessarily immune to these venoms, but rather the badgers skin is so thick and tough that most bee stingers and snake fangs cannot penetrate it.</p>
                        
                    </p>  If the venom of a large snake does get into the system, the badger may be killed, but often just has a coma-like "down time" while it recovers.
                        
                        This may be a few moments or as long as several hours, after which the badger will awake and promptly it finish off its snake dinner.- Amazing!
                        
                        The honey badger has a high metabolism and spends lots of energy crashing around its territory looking for things to consume.
                        
                        There is very little stealth involved here.</p>
                        
                       <p>They risk alerting prey, but also risk aggravating predators such as lions, leopards and hyenas, all of which are considerably larger than the 20 to 35 pound honey badger, and they don't seem to care.
                        
                        They can, occasionally, be killed by these animals, but these predators don't usually take the risk involved in subduing an animals as formidable as the honey badger.
                        
                        The badger will generally bluff, growl and charge it's way out of the situation, even warding off entire prides of lions, which is why the honey badger is commonly considered the fiercest animal on the planet. - Honey Badger Facts.</p>
